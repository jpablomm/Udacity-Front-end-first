                        <i>The Palacio de Bellas Artes</i>
                         (Palace of Fine Arts) is a prominent cultural center
                        in Mexico City. It has hosted some of the most notable events in music, dance, theatre,
                        opera and literature and has held important exhibitions of painting, sculpture and 
                        photography. Consequently, the Palacio de Bellas Artes has been called the "Cathedral 
                        of Art in Mexico". The building is located on the western side of the historic center 
                        of Mexico City next to the Alameda Central park.

                    <p>
                        Mariachi is a genre of Regional Mexican music that dates back to at least the 18th century, 
                        evolving over time in the countryside of various regions of western Mexico. The 
                        usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and 
                        at least one guitar, including a high-pitched vihuela and an acoustic bass guitar 
                        called a guitarrón, and all players taking turns singing lead and doing backup vocals.

                    <p>
                        Agave tequilana, commonly called blue agave (agave azul) or tequila agave,
                         is an agave plant that is an important economic product of Jalisco, Mexico, due 
                        to its role as the base ingredient of tequila, a popular distilled beverage. 
                        The high production of sugars named agavins, mostly fructose, in the core of the 
                        plant is the main characteristic that makes it suitable for the preparation of alcoholic beverages.

                    <h3>Tacos</h3>
                    <p>
                        is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped with a filling. 
                        The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, 
                        including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety. 
                        They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as 
                        lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles. Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread 
                        around the world.

            <h2>Socio-economic Situation</h2>
            <p>
                <q>Mexico is a developing country</q>, ranking 76th on the Human Development Index, but is considered a newly industrialized state by 
                several analysts. It has the world's 15th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the United States 
                being its largest economic partner. The large economy, area, population and politics make Mexico a regional power and a middle 
                power, and is often identified as an emerging power. However, Mexico continues to struggle with social inequalities, poverty 
                and extensive crime; the country ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index. Since 2006, the conflict between the government and 
                drug trafficking syndicates has led to over 120,000 deaths.
